# Data-Wrangling 

Note: This is the report of my wrangling effort 
My definition of data wrangling is like doing a chore. Imagine I have a messy and dirty room. What do I need first? I get a box to gather all my items. I am looking around the room and detects the clutters and dirt to plan. Then, I organize them by dividing my clothes, papers, books, and electronics.  
In this project, I was doing chores on the data with my computer. Three things that I am doing is to gather, assess, and clean data for the purpose to complete my assignment at Data Analysis Udacity Nanodegree.  
 
# Introduction:  

I wrangled the data from a popular Twitter account called, WeRateDogs, where people check or share cute and funny pictures of their dogs. This report consisted of the details of my wrangling effort for this project.

##### The Goal to Complete the project:
  
  - Gather Data 
  - Assessing Data 
  - Clean Data  
  - Vizualize Data
  - Answers the questions 

##### Another Files in data-wrangling:
Gather: There are three files that I have gathered. 

- wrangle_act.ipynb: code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data
- wrangle_report.pdf: documentation for data wrangling steps: gather, assess, and clean
- act_report.pdf or act_report.html: documentation of analysis and insights into final data
- twitter_archive_enhanced.csv: file as given
- image_predictions.tsv: file downloaded programmatically
- tweet_json.txt: file constructed via API
- twitter_archive_master.csv: combined and cleaned data
any additional files (e.g. files for additional pieces of gathered data or a database file for your stored clean data)

### 

##### data-wrangling uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [Jupyter Notebook] or [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [matplotlib] - uses to facilitate the data analyzation by displaying the plots
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.
* [requests] - Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. (source: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
